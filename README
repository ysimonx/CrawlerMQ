MQCrawler is a distributed perl plateform for fast crawling web sites



APACHE ACTIVEMQ SERVER

You need an activemq server with "stomp" protocol activated
you also need to specify your activemq server address
into YSpider.conf


REDIS SERVER

A Redis server is needed in order to store already crawled url
(into the "url" set)
with Ubuntu, you can "apt-get install redis-server"
and specify your redis server address into YSpider.conf

PERL PROGRAMS

you have to start in this order :
master.pl   : retrieves the links (from the "links" queue) to crawl and send the autorized url to crawl to the "crawl" queue   
analyzer.pl : it retrieves the html source (from the "source" topic) and extracts the links present into this source and send them to the "links" queue 
crawler.pl  : retrieves the urls to crawl from the "crawl" queue and gets the source content and send them to the "source" topic.

when everything is done, you can send the first url to crawl to the "crawl" queue
